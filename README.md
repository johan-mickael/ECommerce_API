## ⚠️This is just a basic Ecommerce API for testing. 

❌ **It's a non production-ready repository.**

---

### Features :
- Using an hosted mongodb database
- Public API available for:
    - ✅ Products CRUD (/products)
    - ✅ Carts CRUD (/carts)
    - 🥲 That's all

You should have your own database because mine is private 😛

If needed, the public API endpoint is available [here](https://amazonclone-e14ea0847e3d.herokuapp.com/api)
